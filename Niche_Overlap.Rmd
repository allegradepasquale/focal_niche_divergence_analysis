###This analysis uses the EcoSimR Niche Overlap Shell found at 
http://www.uvm.edu/~ngotelli/EcoSim/EcoSim.html

#Generate estimated marginal means based on negative binomial GLMM found in the script "GLMMs_AmNat_Revised.Rmd"

Bite.emm <- emmeans(BiteCountModel, pairwise ~  Phenotype | TaxonNEW | FruitBiomassCategory, type = "response", adjust = "tukey")

#I then enter these EMMs into .csv files for use in EcoSimR. I generate two .csvs, one for the high fruit season, and one for the low fruit season

low_emm <- read.csv("RevisedPiankaEMM_Low_Jul12.csv")

high_emm <- read.csv("RevisedPiankaEMM_High_Jul12.csv")

###I enter these files as the Data.File in EcoSimR, use default settings, and run the program to obtain Pianka indices:
### High fruit season = .99
### Low fruit season = .73
